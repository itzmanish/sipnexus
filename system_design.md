- Handle media stream setup using SDP negotiation.
- Forward RTP packets between endpoints.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Media Handling:** Use [pion/WebRTC](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) for media transmission.
- **Integration with sipgox:** Coordinate SDP negotiation and media setup.
- **Codec Negotiation:** Manage codec capabilities during SDP negotiation.

**Considerations:**

- **Transcoding Integration:** Interface with the Transcoding Service when needed.

### 6. Load Balancing with Consistent Hashing

**Responsibilities:**

- Distribute SIP requests among server instances without a dedicated proxy.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Hash Function:** Use a consistent hash function (e.g., SHA-256) on the `Call-ID` header.
- **Hash Ring:** Represent server instances on a virtual ring with multiple virtual nodes.
- **Request Routing:** Each instance independently computes the hash and determines if it should handle the request.

**Considerations:**

- **Synchronization:** Ensure all instances use the same hashing algorithm and configurations.
- **Failure Handling:** Implement mechanisms to update the hash ring upon server changes.

### 7. Session Management (Stateless)

**Responsibilities:**

- Maintain minimal session information required for transaction processing.
- Use tokens or IDs embedded in SIP messages for session correlation.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Stateless Tokens:** Embed session identifiers in SIP headers or use the `Call-ID`.
- **Distributed Cache (Optional):** Use Redis if minimal shared state is necessary.

**Considerations:**

- **Failover:** Any instance can handle a session based on the hash function.
- **Data Consistency:** Stateless design minimizes consistency issues.

### 8. Monitoring and Logging

**Responsibilities:**

- Monitor system performance and health.

## Data Flow Diagram

1. **Call Initiation:**

   - A SIP endpoint sends an INVITE request.
   - All SIP Signaling Server instances compute the hash of the `Call-ID`.
   - The instance whose hash range includes the computed hash handles the request.

2. **SIP Signaling:**

   - The SIP Signaling Server processes the INVITE.
   - Performs SDP negotiation for codec selection.

3. **Media Setup:**

   - The Media Gateway sets up RTP streams using pion/WebRTC.
   - If transcoding is required, it interacts with the Transcoding Service.

4. **Media Transmission:**

   - RTP packets are forwarded between endpoints via pion/WebRTC.

5. **Conferencing (If Applicable):**

   - Media streams are sent to the Conferencing Service.
   - The service mixes audio and sends it back to participants.

6. **DTMF Handling:**

   - Out-of-band DTMF tones are detected by the DTMF Handler.

7. **Call Termination:**

   - BYE requests are processed by the SIP Signaling Server.
